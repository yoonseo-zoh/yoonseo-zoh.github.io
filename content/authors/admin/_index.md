I’m a rising 4th year PhD student in Department of Psychology at Princeton University, working with Dr. Molly J. Crockett. I received B.A. in Psychology and Education from Seoul National University with summa cum laude, and M.A. and M.phil. in Psychology (with concentration in Neuroscience) from Yale University.

My research focuses on exploring the interaction between fundamental cognitive processes and systems of moral intuitions, and how they contribute to a wide range of human social behaviors. By integrating insights from decision-making systems, computational models, behavioral economics, and neuroscience, I aim to deepen our understanding of the mechanistic workings of the human social and moral mind.
